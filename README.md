- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iamcamacho1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a geologist, but IÂ´m now currently interested in learning how to program and learning new tools to develop new skills. I want this skill to get a job with it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, NodeJs and a bit of Python.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on linkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-camacho-restrepo/
- âš¡ Fun fact: As a geologist I could know almost every type of rock that you can find! PD: DonÂ´t ask me about Dinosaurs!
