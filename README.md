👋 Hi, I’m @iamcamacho1
👀 I’m a geologist, but I´m now currently interested in learning how to program and learning new tools to develop new skills. I want this skill to get a job with it.
🌱 I’m currently learning React, NodeJs and a bit of Python.
💞️ I’m looking to make a web page were a civil-engineer company can log-in and create different projects, where in each of them, they can create objects (piezometers, either VWP or OHP) which will have some attributes, like depht, date of instalation and so.After that, the costumer will be able to add the periodical lectures on the instrument and it will update a database, which will create graphics and a document were the results are goint to be printed out. 
📫 You can reach me on linkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-camacho-restrepo/
⚡ Fun fact: As a geologist I could know almost every type of rock that you can find! PD: Don´t ask me about Dinosaurs!
